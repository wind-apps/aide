    <!-- TODO: create a setup page (thinking blurred bg, with a modal type thing in the middle)
      where we walk the user through creating an Xata API key, and adding it in an input.
      They could also choose a region etc. if we want to create a DB for them?
      
      Then we store this with electron.safeStorage + electron-store or smth, and use it for our API calls.

      Can run a quick healthcheck too, to make sure it works when inputted.

      Once done, we'll then need to run some migrations, so the screen should have a steps page, with migration progress
      It could also add some initial fake date to demo item.
